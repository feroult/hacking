# shellcode

shellcode 1 - (Nov 25, 1998)
 
this proggie generates a binary execve code for any commands 
with any arguments. it shows the asm and hex  code of execve 
wanted. both outputs asm and hex code can be executed on the 
stack. for example, you can use it when you want to  exploit
a buffer overrun situation on linux.
